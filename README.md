# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### Project goal
Losses related to credit card fraud will grow to $43 billion within five years and climb to $408.5 billion globally within the next decade, according to a recent Nilson Report â€” meaning that credit card fraud detection has become more important than ever. When specific cases of credit card fraud are discovered, the majority of contemporary systems use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to manage data analysis, predictive modeling, decision-making, fraud alerts, and remediation action.

Given the surge in online fraud and digital crime, it is more crucial than ever for businesses to take decisive action to stop payment card fraud using cutting-edge technology and robust security measures. Therefore, this project attempts to evaluate different machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
